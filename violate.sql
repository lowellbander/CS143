/*Now From the constraints that you listed before, identify the ones that can be enforced using either primary key constraints, referential integrity (foreign key) constraints, or CHECK constraints and specify them in SQL. In order to get the full credit, you should specify at least

Three primary key constraints
Six referential integrity constraints, and
Three CHECK constraints

and express them in SQL.*/

-- for each constraint, demonstrate at least one database modification that violates it, and explain why the operation violates the constraint.
